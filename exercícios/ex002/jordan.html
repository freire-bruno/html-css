    So today I woke up feeling great because I had a dream that I was a prince... the son of the queen of vball: Jordan Quinn Larson! <br>Known as the MVP of Tokyo 2020 (or 2021 lol), Larson had an impecable performance alongside her teammates back in the Olympics, winning, finally, the so dreamed Gold Medal, completing her trifecta: Silver, London-2012; Bronze, Rio-2016; Gold, Tokyo-2020.
